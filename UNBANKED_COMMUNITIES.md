## Global Statistics

### The Numbers

**1.4 billion people globally are unbanked**
- 38% of global population
- Mostly in developing countries
- Growing in developed countries too

### By Region

### In Developed Countries

**USA (richest country):**
- 20 million unbanked/underbanked Americans
- Often minorities, immigrants, low-income
- 40% of African Americans are underbanked
- 30% of Latino Americans are underbanked

**Example:** Single mom in US making $25K/year
- Can't get credit from banks
- Uses payday loans at 400% APR
- Stays poor due to predatory lending

## Who Are Unbanked?

### Typical Profile

**Farmer in Kenya**
```
• Income: Seasonal (harvest time only)
• Current: Sells to middleman for 50% of value
• Problem: Can't store crops (no cold storage)
• Problem: Can't get loan to buy storage equipment
• Problem: No credit history (no bank account)
• Result: Poor → Stays poor (no way out)
```

**Domestic Worker in Philippines**
```
• Income: $200/month from household cleaning
• Current: Keeps cash at home (no bank)
• Problem: Money stolen in robberies
• Problem: Can't prove income for loan
• Problem: No credit history
• Result: One robbery = loses everything
```

## The Unbanked Problem

### Financial Exclusion Cycle

```
No bank account
        ↓
No credit history
        ↓
Can't get loans
        ↓

**Social:**
- Stuck in poverty
- Limited opportunity
- Social inequality
- Crime increases
- Inequality deepens

**Personal:**
- Financial stress
- Limited options
- Exploitation by lenders
- Can't build future
- Generational poverty

---

## Why Are They Unbanked?

### Reason 1: Geographic Isolation
**Problem:** No bank branches nearby

```
Example: Farmer in rural Ethiopia
• Nearest bank: 50 km away
• Must take day off work to visit bank
• Travel cost: $5-10 (half a day's wage)
• Bank fees: $2-5 minimum
• Result: Not worth it
```

**Solution:** Mobile banking, blockchain

### Reason 2: No Documentation
**Problem:** No proof of identity, income, or address

```
Example: Street vendor in Indonesia
• No ID (too expensive to get)
• No formal employment letter
• No proof of address
• Bank rejects application
```

**Solution:** Alternative verification (mobile phone, merchant history)

### Reason 3: Minimum Balances Too High
**Problem:** Banks require $50+ minimum balance

```
Example: Daily wage worker in Philippines
• Earns $5-10/day
• Has $20-30 cash at most times
• Bank minimum: $100
• Can't maintain minimum
```

**Solution:** Micro-banking, blockchain

### Reason 4: High Fees
**Problem:** Bank fees exceed their daily earnings

```
Example: Informal worker in USA
• Earns $50/day
• Bank withdrawal fee: $3
• Monthly fees: $10
• That's $3 out of $250 monthly = 12% fee!
```

**Solution:** Free blockchain banking

### Reason 5: Language/Literacy Barriers
**Problem:** Can't understand banking forms

```
Example: Immigrant in Spain
• Speaks Arabic, not Spanish
• Bank forms in Spanish only
• Application rejected
```

**Solution:** Simplified interfaces, local languages

### Reason 6: Discrimination
**Problem:** Banks reject them based on ethnicity, immigration status, etc.

```
Example: Black Americans
• Same income as white Americans
• Denied mortgages/loans more often
• Called "redlining"
• Systemic discrimination
```

**Solution:** Objective algorithms (blockchain credit scoring)

### Reason 7: Lack of Credit History
**Problem:** Catch-22 - need credit to build credit history

```
Example: First-generation immigrant
• Never had credit card
• Never had loan
• Bank: "You have no credit history"
• Immigrant: "How do I get one?"
• Bank: "You can't without..."
• Result: Stuck
```

**Solution:** Alternative credit scoring (your system!)

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Kenya - Mobile Money Pioneer

**Problem:**
- Only 33% of Kenyans have bank accounts
- But 77% have mobile phones
- M-Pesa is huge (mobile money platform)

**Your System Could:**
```
• Verify income through M-Pesa history
• Issue instant loans for farmers
• Enable crop insurance
• Small business expansion
• Result: 20 million more people access credit
```

**Impact on Farmer:**
```
Before:
  • Forced to sell crops immediately to middleman
  • Gets 50% of market price
  • Income: $500/harvest

After (with your system):
  • Gets storage loan ($200)
  • Can store crops until prices rise
  • Sells at 100% market price
  • Income: $1,000/harvest → 2x increase!
```

### Example 2: Philippines - GCash Ecosystem

**Context:**
- 65 million unbanked Filipinos
- 37 million GCash users (mobile money)
- Perfect for blockchain integration

**Your System Could:**
```
• Verify income from GCash transaction history
• Issue instant microloans
• Enable small business growth
• Serve jeepney drivers, street vendors
• Result: Serve 30+ million people
```

**Impact on Vendor:**
```
Before:
  • Street vendor, $8/day income
  • Uses predatory lender at 10% daily interest
  • Borrows $50 = pays back $5/day interest
  • Can't escape debt

After (with your system):
  • ZK proof of income history
  • Instant $500 loan at 8% monthly
  • Expands to stall → $20/day income
  • Pays off loan in 3 months
  • Now has working capital
```

### Example 3: Latin America - Remittance Corridor

**Context:**
- 43 million Latin Americans in USA send money home
- Remittances: $30 billion/year (huge!)
- Family members abroad wait days to receive money

**Your System Could:**
```
• Enable instant stablecoin remittances
• Family receives money in minutes (not days)
• Recipient can get instant microloan
• Uses remittance as proof of income
• Result: Financial inclusion + faster transfers
```

**Impact on Family:**
```
Before:
  • Wife sends $300 from USA
  • Takes 3 days to arrive
  • Bank fee: $15
  • Husband receives: $285
  • Can't get loan against pending transfer

After (with your system):
  • Sends $300 stablecoin instantly
  • Arrives in 2 minutes
  • Fee: $0.01
  • Husband receives: $300
  • Can use as proof of income
  • Gets $1,000 microloan instantly
  • Buys inventory for small store
```

### Example 4: USA - Underbanked Americans

**Context:**
- 20 million Americans unbanked/underbanked
- Mostly minorities, low-income, immigrants
- Trapped in predatory lending

**Your System Could:**
```
• Use gig economy income (DoorDash, Uber, Fiverr)
• Verify through transaction history
• Issue fair-rate credit (not 400% APR payday loans)
• Enable financial stability
• Result: Economic mobility for 20 million people
```

**Impact on Single Mom:**
```
Before:
  • Makes $25K/year + DoorDash side gig
  • Can't get bank credit (no W-2)
  • Uses payday loan at 400% APR
  • Borrows $500 → pays back $650 in 2 weeks
  • Trapped in cycle
  • Can never pay off debt

After (with your system):
  • ZK proof of income from DoorDash history
  • Fair credit at 12% APR
  • Borrows $1,000 for car repairs
  • Pays back $1,080 over 12 months
  • Car keeps working → keeps job
  • Can build emergency fund
  • Financial stability achieved
```

## Why Traditional Banking Fails Unbanked

### Root Problems

**1. Profit Model**
```
Traditional Banking:
  • Profit = (fees) + (interest spread)
  • Serving poor people = low margins
  • Cost of serving = higher than profit
  • Result: Unserved

Your System (Blockchain):
  • Profit = (scale) + (security)
  • Serving 1 million = same cost as 1 thousand
  • Margins improve with scale
  • Result: Profitable to serve everyone
```

**2. Risk Assessment**
```
Traditional Banking:
  • Need credit history (don't have)
  • Need collateral (don't have)
  • Need ID documents (don't have)
  • Result: Can't assess risk → automatic rejection

Your System (Alternative Data):
  • Mobile money history = credit history
  • Blockchain record = collateral substitute
  • ZK proofs = identity verification
  • Result: Can assess risk → selective approval
```

**3. Infrastructure**
```
Traditional Banking:
  • Physical branches needed
  • Employees needed
  • High fixed costs
  • Can't serve remote areas

Your System (Blockchain):
  • Digital only
  • No branches needed
  • Scales globally
  • Serves everywhere
```

## How to Measure Impact

### Metrics Your System Could Track

**Financial Inclusion:**
```
• Number of people getting first loan
• Average loan size
• Default rate
• Repeat loan rate
```

**Economic Impact:**
```
• Average income increase per borrower
• Small businesses created
• Jobs generated
• Poverty reduction
```

**Social Impact:**
```
• School enrollment increase (parents can invest in education)
• Healthcare access improvement
• Housing upgrade (families can buy better homes)
• Generational wealth building
```

### Expected Impact (Conservative)

If deployed in Kenya:
```
Reach: 10 million unbanked people
Loans issued: 5 million in Year 1
Average loan: $500
Average income increase: $200/year
Total income generated: $1 billion/year
Poverty reduction: 2-3 million people

Cost to serve: $0.10 per loan (blockchain)
Traditional bank cost: $50-100 per loan
```

## Talking Points for Your Professor

### "Why I Focused on Unbanked Communities"

**Story 1: The Farmer**
```
"In Kenya, a farmer can't get a $200 loan to buy grain storage.
So he sells his harvest immediately for half the market price.
If he could get credit for storage, his income could double.
But banks say: 'No credit history, no loan.'
Our system says: 'I can see your mobile money history.
Here's a $200 loan at fair rates. Let's see you thrive.'
That's impact."
```

**Story 2: The Immigrant**
```
"In the USA, an immigrant makes $25K/year but can't get credit.
Banks say: 'You have no credit history.'
So she uses a payday lender at 400% APR.
She borrows $500, pays back $650 in 2 weeks.
She never escapes the cycle.
Our system says: 'I can see your employment history.
Here's fair credit. Let's build your future.'
That's justice."
```

**Story 3: The Vision**
```
"1.4 billion people are unbanked. Not because they're poor.
Because the system excludes them.
Blockchain enables financial inclusion at scale.
ZK proofs enable privacy and fairness.
Together, they democratize credit.
That's why this matters."
```
